Subsequent to my writing this application, the idiots at npm decided that the app should delete any packages that were not listed in package.json. That's right, it deletes files that I want but it doesn't like and there is no way to override the behavior.

Turns out that npm does allow installation from a local directory and that puts an entry into package.json and that prevents deleting.

The three directories contained herein are installed via...

npm i node_modules_local_repo/qtools/
npm i node_modules_local_repo//asynchronous-pipe
npm i node_modules_local_repo//qtFunctionalLib

Now I can use npm to update and install new packages.
